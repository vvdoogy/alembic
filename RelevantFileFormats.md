There are a LOT of file formats for efficiently storing structured data out there. Some are more relevant than others.

[HDF5](http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.intro.html) is used for astrophysics. It is very similar to, but a bit more robust than, GTO.

[OpenGTO](http://open-gto.googlecode.com) is the Tweak Films data file format. Useful, but underspecified.

[OpenSceneGraph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg) is an Open Source C++ and !OpenGL scene description API
