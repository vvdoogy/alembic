# Alembic Elevator Test #

In five seconds, Alembic is:

**For** computer graphics professionals working with large, complex scenes;

**Who** need to quickly, reliably transfer CG assets between heterogeneous software tools in order to make use of the widest range of available functionality;

**Alembic** is an Open, Portable, Computer Graphics Storage Format;

**That** is able to accurately store the full range of existing CG primitives, is open and easily extensible for custom data needs, and is fully supported in all the major CG animation, rendering, and simulation tools;

**Unlike** FBX, which is not extensible or open, or COLLADA, which is unable to store large assets, or custom solutions using GTO, which are non-standardized and require too much implementation-specific knowledge.
