# Introduction #

The "Elevator Test Statement" looks like this:

> **_For_** (target customer)

> **_Who_** (statement of the need or opportunity)

> **_The_** (product name) **_is a_** (product category)

> **_That_** (key benefit, compelling reason to buy).

> **_Unlike_** (competitive offerings, product name differentiates itself by)

This is taken from Jim Highsmith's book, Agile Project Managment, pgs 93 and 94. That might look a bit abstract, so here's why you might want one ...

The product vision box and elevator test statement together vividly depict a product vision. Results may vary widely - presentations by each of the groups are then followed by a discussion of how the different focal points can be reduced to a few that everyone agrees upon. **This event emphasizes that projects produce products. Some projects (e.g., internal IT projects) may not create products for the external market, but viewing them as products for an internal market keeps the team grounded in a customer-product mindset.** Whether the project results involve enhancements to an internal accounting system or a new digital camera, product-oriented thinking reaps benefits.

# Alembic Elevator Test #

**For** computer graphics professionals working with large, complex scenes;

**Who** need to quickly, reliably transfer CG assets between heterogeneous software tools in order to make use of the widest range of available functionality;

**Alembic** is an Open, Portable, Computer Graphics Storage Format;

**That** is able to accurately store the full range of existing CG primitives, is open and easily extensible for custom data needs, and is fully supported in all the major CG animation, rendering, and simulation tools;

**Unlike** FBX, which is not extensible or open, or COLLADA, which is unable to store large assets, or custom solutions using GTO, which are non-standardized and require too much implementation-specific knowledge.
