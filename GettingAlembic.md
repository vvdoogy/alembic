# Using Mercurial #

Go to http://code.google.com/p/alembic/source/checkout and follow the instructions.  This will get you our main repository, which will contain both the "default" branch as well as any named release branches.  The named release branches should be very stable: only bugfixes go into them.  "default" is not guaranteed to be buildable or less buggy than a release branch.

# Download a the zipped archive #

Go to http://code.google.com/p/alembic/wiki/Downloads and click on the link to the latest version; that will be a copy of the state of something very near to the tip of the latest release branch.

# Building Alembic #

Once you have the source code, there is a `README.txt` file at the root level of the source.  It contains instructions for building Alembic.
